Attendance management Systems was primarily created for better managing the college attendance at Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management 
and Engineering.To brief, In India colleges record students attendance in order to understand the number of lectures they've attended in order 
to learn the in-class strength. However, sometimes these were manipulated as the system implemented the traditional Excel-and-Email method. 

Therefore, this system basically updates the system based upon the student information. 

Here, Attendace_old is basically a back-up version of the newer implementation. 
Under the Attendance_All, you will provide you with excel creation features, excel download features. One can basically create the student
information in excel and upload the particular on the server. The server will generate the student information with which you may record the data.
At the end of the term one can download this data in excel format, as some like having it in paper format.
